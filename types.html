      <div class="type-box">
        <h3>1. Economic Globalization</h3>
        <p style="color: black;">
          Economic globalization refers to the increasing interdependence of world economies. It involves the expansion of international trade, foreign investment, and the spread of multinational corporations. As companies operate across borders, countries become more financially linked. Examples include free trade agreements, global supply chains, and international labor markets.

      <div class="type-box">
        <h3>2. Cultural Globalization</h3>
        <p style="color: black;">
          Cultural globalization is the worldwide spread of ideas, languages, food, music, fashion, and values. It allows people to experience other cultures and influences how we think, dress, eat, and communicate. The spread of Hollywood films, global fast-food chains, or social media trends are all examples of cultural globalization.

      </div>

      <div class="type-box">
        <h3>3. Technological Globalization</h3>
        <p style="color: black;">
          This type of globalization involves the rapid spread of technologies and innovations across the world. The internet, smartphones, and cloud computing have connected people globally in real-time. Technological globalization helps bridge gaps in communication, education, healthcare, and business operations across borders.

      <div class="type-box">
        <h3>4. Political Globalization</h3>
        <p style="color: black;">
          Political globalization is the growing influence of international organizations and global political cooperation. Countries work together on shared issues like peacekeeping, climate change, and human rights. Institutions like the United Nations (UN), European Union (EU), and World Trade Organization (WTO) are key examples.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="type-box">
        <h3>5. Environmental Globalization</h3>
        <p style="color: black;">
          Environmental globalization refers to how environmental issues cross borders. Climate change, deforestation, and pollution affect the whole planet. Global environmental efforts—like the Paris Agreement—are examples of countries working together to protect the Earth and promote sustainable development.
